<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hey! I am Alicia and welcome to my portfolio.</h2>
<p>My inspiration for learning how to code and complete the web development course started by losing a toenail traumatically at a limp bizkit concert.
  A fortnight off at work made me dip back into something i haven't done since i was 15 years old and had a Myspace profile, tinkering with code and layouts to have the best MySpace page EVER!
</p>

<p>After searching for a side project alonside my full time job, i decided to try coding and web development again and so purchased a Udemy course in their sale :) and here i am, not gotten bored yet and that's a big thing for me!</p>

<p>I am a full time Nurse, at a busy NHS hospital on a Critical Care department. I have a big fur baby Great Dane called Ragnar, who has his own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bigboyragnar" target="_blank">Instagram.</a> I live with my partner Daniel who i have been in a relationship with for 17 years and we have a cute little house together with our furbaby.
I enjoy working out at the gym, cooking/eating out, coding and travelling when i can! My goal is to buy a large van to convert so i can travel with Dan and Ragnar while freelancing as a web developer! </p>
